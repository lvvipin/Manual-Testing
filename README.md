Agile Methodology

Agile model /Agile methodology /Agile process.

▪ It is an Iterative and Incremental Approach.

▪ Iterative means same process repeating again and again.(The process keeps on repeating).

▪ Incremental means, modules/features keep on adding on top of existing software.

▪ Agile is Iterative and Incremental model where requirements keeps on changing.

▪ As a company we should be flexible to accept requirements change, develop, test and finally
release a peace of working software within short span of time.

▪ There will be good communication between Customer, Business Analyst, Developers & Testers.

▪ The Goal of the agile model is the customer satisfaction by delivering the piece of the software to
the customer within short span of time.

▪ Agile Testing is type of testing where we follow the agile principles.

Advantages & Disadvantages

▪ Advantages:

▪ Requirement changes are allowed in any stage of development (or) We can accommodate
Requirement changes in the middle of development.

▪ Releases will be very fast( Weekly)

▪ Customer no need to wait for long time.

▪ Good communication between team.

▪ It is very easy model to adopt.

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//

▪ Disadvantage:

▪ Less focus on design and documentation since we deliver software very faster.

What is Scrum?

▪ Scrum is a framework through which we build software product by following Agile Principles.

▪ Scrum includes group of people called as Scrum team. Normally contains 5-9 members.

– Product Owner

– Scrum Master

– Dev Team

– QA Team

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//

▪ Product Owner :

– Define the features of the product

– Prioritize features according to market value

– Adjust features and priority every iteration, as needed

– Accept or reject work results.

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//

▪ Scrum Master:

– The main role is facilitating and driving the agile process.

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//

▪ Developers and QA:

– Develop and Test the software.

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//

Scrum Terminology

▪ User Story : A Feature/module in a software

▪ Epic : Collection of user stories.

▪ Product backlog : Contains list of user stories. Prepared by product owner.

▪ Sprint : Period of time to complete the user stories, decided by the product owner and team, usually 2-4
weeks of time.

▪ Sprint planning meeting: Meating conducts with the team to define what can be delivered in
the sprint and duration.

▪ Sprint backlog : List of committed stories by Dev/QA for specific sprint.

▪ Scrum meeting : Meating conducted by Scrum Master everyday 15 mins. Called as Standup meeting.

– What did you do yesterday?

– What will you do today?

– Are there any impediments in your way?

▪ Sprint retrospective meeting : Review meeting after completion of sprint. The entire team, including
both the ScrumMaster and the product owner should participate.

▪ Story point : Rough estimation of user stories, will be given by Dev & QA in the form of Fibonacci series.

▪ Burndown chart : Shows how much work remining in the sprint. Maintained by the scrum master daily.
